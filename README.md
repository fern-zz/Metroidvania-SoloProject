### About the Project
This is a passion project I plan to continue improving and expanding with new mechanics, levels, and visual polish. Given the limited timeframe, I wasn't able to create or animate all the assets I envisioned. But, those are coming soon.
This project is far from finished. Itâ€™s the foundation of something I care deeply about and intend to keep building.

### Features
- Responsive player movement, jumping, and pogo-style attacks
- Enemy AI with patrol, detection, and directional attacks
- Sanity and health systems with real-time UI feedback
- Audio system using Unity AudioMixer + volume controls
- Parallax background, animated UI, and original art layout
- Organized, event-based C# systems
